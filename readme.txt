Add more advanced custom fields types to your edit post page. Field can be of several types, including textarea, checkbox, radio buttons, files and color picker.

== Description ==

Simple Fields for WordPress let you add groups of fields to your edit post page.

Simple Fields turns WordPress into an even more powerful Content Management System (CMS).

#### Features and highlight

* Add textboxes, text areas, checkboxes, radio buttons, dropdowns, and file browser to the post admin area
* Much easier for the user than regular custom fields
* Group fields together into logical groups. For example combine File + Name + Description into a an Attachments-group, that let's you add multiple files to your posts
* Use "repeatable" field groups to add many any amount of field groups to a single post (great for images or attachments!)
* Use drag and drop to change order of added repeatable groups
* Different post types can use different field groups - actually you can even use different field groups even for same post type
* Can be used on any post type, including custom post types
* Nice GUI that looks like it belongs to the regular WordPress GUI

Simple fields now supports registering field groups and fields with php code. For example, try this in your functions.php:

--- 8< ---

simple_fields_register_field_group('test',
                array (
                    'name' => 'Test field group',
                    'description' => "Test field description",
                    'repeatable' => 1,
                    'fields' => array(
                                    array('name' => 'Test text',
                                          'description' => 'Text description',
                                          'type' => 'text'
                                    ),
                                    array('name' => 'Test textarea',
                                          'description' => 'Textarea description',
                                          'type' => 'textarea',

== Screenshots ==

1. A post in edit, showing two field groups: "Article options" and "Article images".
These groups are just example: you can create your own field groups with any combinatin for fields.
See that "Add"-link above "Article images"? That means that it is repeatable, so you can add as many images as you want to the post.

2. One field group being created (or modified).

3. Group field groups together and make them available for different post types.


== Changelog ==

#### Version 1.1.5
- Added "view" link to file field, so you can view images/attachments/pdfs/whatever directly from the edit post screen.

#### Version 1.1.4
- Added support for dropdowns with multiple selected values. Just check "multiple" in the settings for the dropdown field and voila!
- Changed all jQuery javascript live events to on events, because live is deprecated.
- Removed several javscript actions that were called on edit post page. Hopefully makes the edit post screen a bit quicker when working with repeatable custom fields
- Probably some misc stuff I don't remember

#### Version 1.1.3
- Fixed date and time picker not working in Firefox (I spend way too much time in Chrome nowadays...)
- Changed date and time picker to use simplified ISO 8601 return format
- Changed repeatable fields to be a bit more nice looking, IMHO anyway :)
- Changed file field to show "edit" and "remove"-links only on mouse over. Yes, I really want less clutter in my plugin.
- Fixed some notice warnings
- Fixed: use built in function to remove meta instead of direct sql calls. fixes some problem in wp 3.5b. And it feel a lot less dirty.
- Misc other stuff

#### Version 1.1.2
- Fixed script error (sortable not found) on settings page.
- Fixed problem with return values, field divider gave an error...
- Fixed wrong position of repeater drag handle (wrong position on repeating fields)
- Added: method edit_save() for Field Extensions API. Let you modify the values before being saved in database. (Actually this was added in last version, but I forgot about it then..)

#### Version 1.1.1
- Fixed: styles and scripts where not outputed on all post types

#### Version 1.1
- Added: new field type "Date and Time Picker". It's a better version of the Date field. With this new field type you can choose to have a date picker, time picker, or a picker with both date and time. The saved values are stored in ISO 8601-format in the database, so they should be fine to sort posts by when using wp_query.
- Addded: action "simple_fields_admin_head". Use it to add content to the head of admin pages that use simple fields, i.e. the edit post screen. This action is better than admin_head because it's only fired on pages that use simple fields, so all other admin pages will be faster since they don't have to parse any unnecessary.
- Added: action "simple_fields_enqueue_scripts". Same as above, but used to enqueue scripts.
- Fixed: don't output debug info when calling the_excerpt()
- Changed: some GUI changes, like moving the description to below the labels on edit post screen. It became to inconsistent to have the description at different places for different field types.
- Changed: only load styles and scripts on screens that use simple fields. Should speed up other parts of WordPress a little bit.

#### Version 1.0.6
- Added: date_i8n-format for date field when using extended return values
- Added: support for extended return values for function simple_fields_get_post_value()
- Fxed: added group to cache functions + clears the cache when using the register-functions
- Fixed: file dialog javascript now checks that the pagenow variable exists before trying to use it. Hopefully fixes problems with Post Thumbnail Editor
 and other plugins that also use the file dialog.
- Changed: hide "show time" for date field, since we don't use it for anything

#### Version 1.0.5
- Added: field group slug to field group wrapper css + field wrapper css on edit post screen, so you can style different field groups differently.
- Added: new method: get_field_group(): returns an array with info about a field group by using id or slug
- Added: new function: simple_fields_fieldgroup(). Works like simple_fields_value(s) but for a complete fieldgroup. 
Pretty good "shortcut" when you want to get all the field values in a field group.
- Added: new method get_field_by_slug. Returns a field from a fieldgroup using their slugs.
- Fixed: Added wp_cache to some very commonly used functions. Quick tests with Xdebug shows a noticable faster performance.
- Changed: method get_field_groups() adds a key with name field_group with some info about the field group that the field belongs to. 
Useful since sometimes when you use for example get_field_by_slug() to get a single field, you want to know some basic info about the 
field group it belongs to, like the id or slug.
- Changed: function sf_d also shows if a variable is a boolean.

#### Version 1.0.4
- Added: Add button added to bottom of the added field groups. Will be visible when more than 1 field group is added.
- Changed: moved to a two column mode/appearance. Makes the fields take upp less space, and making it more clutter free.
- Changed: minor CSS fixes here and there

#### Version 1.0.3
- Added: Added options for returning values as "Extended Return Values". 
Very useful when working with for example files: 
instead of just the ID of the file you get the id, the full path to the file, the dimensions if it's a image, and more. 
This feature is available for these field types: 
file, radiobutton, dropdown, post, user, taxonomy, taxonomy term and date. 
Please see the [documentation for Extended Return Values](http://simple-fields.com/documentation/api/extended-return-values/) for more information and examples.
- Added: option to set the height for textarea fields (inlcuding HTML/TinyMCE-editor-mode)
- Added: new field type: divider. Useful if you have a field group with many fields. By adding the divider field to a field group it simply created a shite space or a space with a line. It's written using the new Extension API btw, so feel free to check out the source if you want to create something similar yourself.
- Changed: The debug output also includes example on how to get all field in a field group at once.
- Changed: The edit field group admin page now is a bit more compact. Makes easier to get an overview of all the added fields.

#### Version 1.0.2
- Changed: Don't load example field types
- Fixed: jQuery is needed for debug output but was not enqueued
- Added: French translation. Thank you very much, translator!
- Small bugfixes
- Added unit tests. Hopefully this makes it easier for me to spot bugs in the future. Btw: these are the first unit tests I've ever written, so please feel free to comment on the way I've done it! :)

#### Version 1.0.1
- Fixed: some warning and notice-errors, for example when a post connector did not have any field groups connected

#### Version 1.0
- Note: This is a pretty big update, so please backup your databases before installation!
- Added: Support for adding Custom Field Types/Field Type extensions. Makes Simple Fields Endless Extendable! :)
- Added: New functions for registering field groups and fields in php, see example usage.
- Added: New better/easier functions for getting the saved values for a post: simple_fields_value() and simple_fields_values()
- Added: Field slugs and field group slugs. Now you can use the slug instead of the id to get the values.
- Added: Added CSS classes to field groups in admin area, so developers can style things there.
- Added: Actions and filter so developers can modify parts of Simple Fields behavior.
- Added: Functions for getting the connector for the current post. See simple_fields_connector() and simple_fields_is_connector().
- Added: Function to set value, see simple_fields_set_value()
- Added: German translation by Johann Heyne (http://johannheyne.de). Thanks a lot!
- Fixed: Simple Fields is now mostly a class.
- Fixed: Various bugfixes.

#### 0.5
- Added: New function: simple_fields_query_posts(). Fetch and sort posts by simple fields value.
- Fixed: An incompatibility with Wordpress 3.3 prevented saving of default post connector.
- Fixed: An incompatibility with the new TinyMCE in Wordpress 3.3 caused the HTML-editor to not show.
- Fixed: An incompatibility with the new media uploader in Wordpress 3.3 caused the "insert into post"-button to not show in the media library.

#### 0.4 
- Massive update!
- Backup: Lots of new stuff in this version of the plugin, so pleeeeeeease make sure you backup your stuff before installing this. Things may be borked.
- Added: new field type: taxonomy term! Select taxonomy terms, from any taxonomy in the system. The development of this field type was sponsored by http://plucera.se. Thanks guys!
- Added: new field type: taxonomy! Select a taxonomy from a drop down with all the taxonomies in the system. The development of this field type was sponsored by http://plucera.se. Thanks guys!
- Added: new field type: post! Select a post from one or several post types. The development of this field type was sponsored by http://plucera.se. Thanks guys!
- Added: new field type: user! Select a user from a dropdown of all users in the system.
- Added: now it's possible to add a description to each field. It will be displayed under the field name, in italic and a bit brighter.
- Added: new field type: color! Let's you pick a color using a nice colorpicker from http://jscolor.com/
- Added: new field type: date! Let's you pick a date using a nice date picker from http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/datePicker/v2/demo/
- Added: option to hide the built-in wordpress editor (so you can show only fields from simple fields for a post or page)
- Added: Field type file now has a edit-link so it's easy to edit the attachment. Previosly you had to search for the name in the media library = it was very cumbersome. Now = super easy!
- Fixed: last group of a repeatable group could not be deleted under some circumstances
- Fixed: TinyEditor/HTML-editor now remembers line breaks and stuff when switching between visual and HTML.
- Fixed: if "inherit" was used as the simple fields for a post and the post was saved it would get the inherited connector as the saved one. should be kept "inherit" so it's easier to change the connector of a lots of post (by just changing the connector of the parent)
- Added: the name of the inherited connector is now shown when editing a post
- Fixed: jquery ui core and effect highligt are now loaded locally. googlecode.com was awfally slow at times.
- Fixed: field groups, fields, and connector had problems with apostrophes and similar chars.
- Fixed: post did not get inherit as connector, even if it was set to that is post type defaults
- Fixed: full screen disabled for field type tinymce/html since it updated the wrong textarea/tinymce.
- Updated: jquery.effects.core and jquery.effects.color updated to latest version
- Finally: probably lots of other stuff has been fixed too. And if you like this plugin, please consider donating or thanking me in some other way. Looooots of time has been spent on this plugin. And when I mean lots of time, I really mean like hundreds of hours.


#### 0.3.9
- Added: debug page
- Fixed: If a field group was renamed, that was not reflected in the post connector edit screen
- Fixed: some notice-errors (the wp debug bar is wonderful, btw!)
- Fixed: Sometimes a deleted field group would still show up when editing a post

#### 0.3.8
- Better handling of international chars when selecting file
- html_esc on file names
- Repeatable fields did not work in Safari

#### 0.3.7
- Now more localized than ever before. Lots of thanks to Ricardo Tomasi who made the required changes.
- Added Brazilian translation, also by Ricardo Tomasi.
- Added donate-sidebar

#### 0.3.6
- Removed some old code that had security issues. You should update to this version as soon as possible.

#### 0.3.5
- Think I broke the regular media browser witht he last update. Should be fixed now. Sorry everyone!

#### 0.3.4
- effects.core.js and effects.highlight.js actually points to existing files now
- adding repeatable field groups would "hang" due to the fact that effects.highlight was missing. so should be fixed now too.
- media browser would hang on chrome (and safari too i guess). should be fixed now.

#### 0.3.3
- Use jquery-ui version 1.7.3 instead of 1.8.1, since that's the version otherwise used by WordPress.
- If FORCE_SSL_ADMIN is set to true, jquery-ui-stuff is loaded from Google through HTTPS instead of plain HTTP. Please let me know if this solves the problems some of you had.
- removed post_id from media select querystring. should make it not add the selected image to the gallery/attach it to the post
- media browser: filter and search now works
- media browser: finally managed to change the name of the "insert into post"-button. Code gracefully stolen/inspired by the Attachments-plugin (http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/attachments/)
- uses nonce when saving. should fix a couple of bugs, for example post connector being reseted
- if multiple file fields where in a single group, clearing one file would clear them all
- Hopefully fixed some more stuff that I can't remember. ..and probably broke some stuff too. Make a backup before installing, people! And let me know of any bugs you find!

#### 0.3.2
- Fixed a problem with checkboxes and multiple fields (as reported here: http://eskapism.se/code-playground/simple-fields/comment-page-1/#comment-73892). I hope. Please make sure you make a backup of your database before upgrading. Things may go boom!

#### 0.3.1
- simple_fields_get_post_group_values would return an array with one element with a value of null, if a repeatable field group did not have any added items. kinda confusing.
- fixed a couple of undefined index-errors

#### 0.3
- Field type file now uses wordpress own file browser, so upload and file browsing should work much better now. If you still encounter any problems let me know. Hey, even if it works, please let med know! :)
- Media buttons for tiny now check if current user can use each button before adding it (just like the normal add-buttons work)

#### 0.2.9
- Fixed a JavaScript error when using the gallery function
- Fixed a warning when using simple_fields_get_post_value() on a post with no post

#### 0.2.8
- fixed errors when trying to fetch saved values for a post with no post_connector selected
- tinymce-fields can now be resized (does not save them correctly afterwards though...)
- uses require_once instead of require. should fix some problems with other plugins.
- clicking on "+ Add" when using repeatable fields the link changes text to "Adding.." so the user will know that something is happening.
- removed media buttons from regular (non-tiny) textareas
- tiny-editor: can now switch between visual/html

#### 0.2.7
- file browser had some <? tags instead of <?php
- Could not add dropdown values in admin

#### 0.2.6
- media buttons for tinymce fields
- fixed some js errors
- content of first tinymce-editor in a repeatable field group would lose it's contents during first save

- moved some code from one file to another. really cool stuff.

#### 0.2.4

- file browser: pagination was a bit off and could miss files

#### 0.2.3
- some problems with file browser (some problems still exist)

- removed field type "image". use field type "file" instead.
